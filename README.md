👋 Hi, I’m @J4H20M3

🌱 I’m currently working on [jahro.me](http://jahro.me)

It's built on my  [vanillaspa](https://github.com/vanillaspa/) framework, which in fact is no framework, but standards-conforming WebComponents.

You can also start building anything you want with 

```git clone https://github.com/vanillaspa/vanillaspa.git```

and start creating sustainable Web.

💞️ Take the red pill
📫 You can reach me @jahro_me
